# A very simple AI challenge game written by David Brenner for CSH (csh.rit.edu)
"""
It's a snowball fight! The rules are as follows.

Each turn, a player can:
    Do nothing
    Move in a direction
    Make a snowball
    Throw a snowball in a direction
    Build a snowman  in a direction

Actions that require a direction can be done in the cardinal or intermediate 
    directions (N, S, E, W, NE, NW, SW, SE).

Invalid actions result in inaction. These include:
    Moving somewhere where you can't move
    Throwing a snowball when you don't have one

Snowmen are stationary shields. They are destroyed by collision with a player
    or snowball.

When a player loses, the player is removed from the game.

Players lose by:
    Colliding into one another (both players lose)
    Getting hit by a snowball

Players win by:
    Being the last in the game
